## Cross-Platform Comparison: FF Human Ovarian Cancer with Xenium v1 and Xenium Prime 5K

In situ gene expression dataset analyzed using Xenium Onboard Analysis 4.0.0.

## Overview

These datasets are from adjacent tissue sections:

- **Xenium v1**: In situ gene expression with cell segmentation for human ovarian cancer (FF) using the Xenium Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel plus 100 custom genes (~477 genes).
- **Xenium Prime 5K**: In situ gene expression with cell segmentation for human ovarian cancer (FF) using the Xenium Prime 5K Human Pan Tissue and Pathways Panel (~5000 genes).

Visium HD and HD 3' spatial gene expression datasets from tissue sections adjacent to the Xenium sections are also available from 10x Genomics.

## Gene panels

- **Xenium Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel (377 genes)**: Pre-designed by 10x Genomics using Human Protein Atlas data. Genes chosen for cell typing and identification of immune, proliferation, and tumor markers in breast, lung, skin, liver, colon, kidney, lung cancer, and heart.
- **100 custom genes**: Selected for identifying cells in human ovarian cancer.
- **Xenium Prime 5K Human Pan Tissue and Pathways Panel**: Designed for cell type and state identification, canonical signaling pathways, developmental biology, immuno-oncology, and genes from biomedical literature.
